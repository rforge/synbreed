Dairy cattle data
}
\description{
Data set contains genotypic, phenotypic, map and pedigree data of 500 bulls. All individuals are labeled with an unique ID, starting with ID1430 and ending with ID1929. Genotypic and pedigree data is based on  a real cattle data set while phenotypes were built artificially.  Pedigree information is available at least on parents and grandparents of the phenotyped individuals.

There are two quantitative phenotypes available. The heritabilities of these traits are 0.41 and 0.66, estimated with a pedigree-based animal model using the data set on hand.

Genotypic data consists of 7250 biallelic SNP markers for every phenotyped individual with missing data included. SNPs are mapped across all 29 autosomes. Distances in the SNP map are given in mega bases (Mb).
