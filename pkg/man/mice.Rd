Heterogenous stock mice population
}
\description{
Data set comprises public available data of 2527 (1293 males and 1234 females) heterogenous stock mice derived from eight inbred strains (A/J, AKR/J, BALBc/J, CBA/J, C3H/HeJ, C57BL/6J, DBA/2J and LP/J) followed by 50 generations of pseudorandom mating. All individuals are labeled with a unique ID, starting with  \code{A048005080}. For all individuals, family, sex (females=0, males=1), month of birth (1-12), birthyear, coat color, cage density and litter is available and stored in \code{covar}.

 The measured traits are described in Solberg et al. (2006). Here, the body weight at age of 6 weeks [g] and growth slope between 6 and 10 weeks age [g/day] are available. The heritabilities of these traits are reported as 0.74 and 0.30, respectively (Valdar et al, 2006b). Phenotypic data was taken from \url{http://mus.well.ox.ac.uk/GSCAN/HS_PHENOTYPES/Weight.txt}.
 
 Genotypic data consists of 12545 biallelic SNP markers and is available for 1940 individuals. Raw genotypic data from \url{http://mus.well.ox.ac.uk/GSCAN/HS_GENOTYPES/} is given in the \code{Ped-File Format} with two columns for each marker. Both alleles were combined to a single genotype for each marker in \code{mice} data. The SNPs are mapped in a sex-averaged genetic map with distances given in centimorgan (Shifman et al. (2006)). SNPs are mapped across all 19 autosomes and X-chromosome where distances between adjacent markers vary form 0 to 3 cM.
